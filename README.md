# HTML Templates
A collection of templates including HTML, CSS, and more to come!

## Purpose
I will be using these files to help me with practicing [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). They may be useful for other applications, too.

These files are organized according to their usage within the Flask microframework. HTML files are in the `templates` directory. CSS files (and possibly JavaScript in the future) are in the `static` directory.
